This is the first assignment for research and implementation due the 11/10/15

Suppose you have been hired by a renewable fuels company, who want to locate a processing plant somewhere in Ireland. They already have several raw materials locations in Ireland, where they cut down trees. They have decided that the new plant will be at one of those locations. The idea is that wood from all locations will be transported by road to the processing plant, and then the product will be transported by road to some port. You have been asked to choose the location for the processing plant and the choice of port, so as to minimize the total road transportation costs

End goal: Find the location that provides the lowest road transport costs.
